# Mall-customer-Segmentation
# GOAL:
The goal of the project to group the customers of a Mall baesd on their purchase history.




# 1.Data Collection
The data is collected from kaggle 'Mall Customer Segmentation Data'.



# 2.Exploratory Data Analysis
Extracting the data information and description.
Anaylsing the number of Male and Female.
Analysing the distplot of age,annual income,spending score and anylsing a confusion matrix.

processing
Data preprocessing include only data cleaning which include the dropping of customer Id as there is no Null values present in the dataet.



# Model Training in 2D 
Training the model by using K-Means Clustering algorithm(unsupervised learning).
Find the elbow point as 5 after plotting the linear plot between WCSS and number of clusters. 
Number of clusters will be 5.


# Evaluation of Model in two dimensional


Predicting the model for 5 clusters.
The resultant scatter plot gives the accurate result by clustering the customers.

# Evaluation of model in three dimensional



The model is trained in 3D same as in 2D.
